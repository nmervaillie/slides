* Is it only CDD ("Conference Driven Developement") with hype and fun?
* Not only: 
** you can **view** (make the system real, touchable, affordable and repeatable) and **break safely** things (sandbox, safety for learning curve)
** maps reality of IT platform without the organisation bias: you are responsible of ALL layers (cost, hardware, system and softwae) and all processes.

** Performances
